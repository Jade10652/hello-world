Hello earth people,

Do you know that space travel is available to everyone? Thanks to those brilliant scientists and the
technology they invented. One of my dreams is to travel in space to witness the birth and the death of nebulas
and galaxies. And now this dream comes true.

OK...let's go back to reality, above is one of my daydreams, and now you know I am a person who likes fantasy
and sci-fi stories!

Ohhh...One thing I forget to mention, I am a fan of Star Wars. May the force be with you.
